# Notes
1. Definitions related to data science
  * Clustering: an unsupervised learning technique aiming at "maximizing the intraclass similarity and minimizing the interclass similarity". Two key parts: feature selection and expectation maximization (EM)
  * The examples of clustering algorithms:
    * distance-based methods: k-means and k-medians
    * density and grid-based methods: DBSCAN
    * matrix factorization-based methods: it is for the data which is represented as sparse nonnegative matrices -- co-clustering.
    * spectral-based methods: Working with the defined underlying similarity matrix
    * graph-based methods: clustering data by converting the similarity matrix to be a network structure.
  * six Vs of big data: volume, velocity, variety, veracity, variablility and value.
